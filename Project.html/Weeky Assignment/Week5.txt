        <h1><i>Beware of password hackers and crackers!</i></h1>
    </center>
    <p>
        The threat of hackers and crackers is for real, and is alike for everything for everyone. If the security breach at the Babha Atomic Research Center last year by the hacker group milworm didnâ€™t convince you of their capabilities, then consider this: James Davis aka jdavis_a, a resident of <a href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bit/2483">www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bit/2483</a> homestead community on the Internet, might just be reading your e-mail in your mailbox right now, or using your account for some benign Internet surfing, or exchanging it with someone else on the Net for more such accounts!

    <p>Surprised? Or scared?</p>

        Whatever it is, jdavis_a claims in his home page Free VSNL passwords that he has got exactly 108 working passwords (and growing daily), 36 satyam, 31 MNTL, 11 WimiNet and 23 online passwords.

    <h1>What is Web Design?</h1>
    <p>
        Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than software development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has become ever-increasingly important.
